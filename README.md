HttpClientFactory in a console application. Examples of Named clients and Typed clients. It uses DI.

Make sure you have least .NET Core SDK. I used SDK v2.1.403.
If .NET Core SDK is not installed on your computer, you can download the latest version: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download

Open solution file in Visual Studio 2017.
Please wait until Visual Studio installs and updates the necessary npm dependencies. 
(This may take a few minutes when you open it for the first time)

Rebuild, and Run!
